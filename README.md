# Organize Trips with GitHub

How it works: GitHub issue templates + turning `[ ]` into checkboxes = ❤️

To plan a trip:

1. Create an issue
2. Select an issue template aka a type of trip.  
   This populates the issue body with the text of the template,
   effectively turning it into a base checklist.
3. Change the issue text as needed
4. After the issue is created, simply checking the boxes will update
   the issue in place.
5. Repeat 3 and 4 until the trip is complete.

Optional:

- open a PR with the artifacts for/of the trip: GPX routes,
  links to places, photos, etc
- invite trip buddies to collaborate on the trip. It can be as simple
  as adding comments on the issue == trip, to sending PRs of their own.
